# Welcome!

I am a postdoctoral researcher in Computer Science at the University of California, Santa Barbara, where I work in Security Lab (SecLab) led by [Dr. Christopher Kruegel](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=f0NoTC0AAAAJ&hl=en) and [Dr. Giovanni Vigna](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=2eM6GocAAAAJ&hl=en). My research is centered on Computer Security, specifically focusing on System Security and Formal Methods. The primary aim of my work is to develop automated program analysis tssechniques addressing different security challenges. You can find a list of my publications below or on my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=EX7bNscAAAAJ&hl=en) page.

Before coming to UCSB, I was a postdoctoral researcher at CISPA, where I worked with [Dr. Christian Rossow](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=lNn4hRMAAAAJ&hl=en).
I obtained my Diploma from Orenburg State University, my Masterâ€™s degree from Saarland University, and my PhD from TU Wien under the supervision of [Dr. Matteo Maffei](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=WWM2IcAAAAAJ). You can see more about my background in my [CV](https://ylya.github.io/cv.pdf).

I enjoy engaging in conversations and am always open to communication via email.
