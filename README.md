# Welcome!

I am a PhD candidate in Mathematics at the University of California, Santa Barbara, where I work in Geometric Analysis under the guidance of [Prof. Guofang Wei]([https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=f0NoTC0AAAAJ&hl=en](https://web.math.ucsb.edu/~wei/)) My research interest lies in geometric inequalities under various curvature assumptions. 

I am on the job market for positions starting Fall 2025.

Research Interests:
I have focused on Sobolev and isoperimetric problems
I've been working on intermediate Ricci curvature which is an interpolation between Ricci and sectional curvature.
I investigate how to apply this to extend previous results that hold true for sectional curvature but are not true for Ricci curvature lower bounds.
Another focus of my work lies in integral curvature that measures the amount of curvature above a certain boundary in the Lp sense.

I'm as excited to share math as I am to study it, so I organize a Very Applied Fluid Dynamics seminar which involves the careful study of solution composed by approximately 95% water. 
I have also embarked on a journey to make the perfect pizza, although this is a lifetime journey. I am happy to share my progress.

You can see more about my background in my [CV](https://ylya.github.io/cv.pdf).

I enjoy engaging in conversations and am always open to communication via email.
